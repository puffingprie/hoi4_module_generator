# Info
Generates modules. This is some great stuff. Gave me brain aneurysm
# Usage
1. Have Python
2. Put the modules you want in your text file in the directory: eg. `data.txt` (Remember to remove `equipment_modules = {}` identifiers)
4. Go into `module_codegen.py`, scroll to bottom and edit `file_names` to include your new text file
5. Change generation options to fit your needs: `{ "items_to_generate": int, "num_to_advance": int }`
6. Run command:
```bash
python3 module_codegen.py
```

I hate python
